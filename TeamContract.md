# Team Contract

---
## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

---
## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* We will use Instagram and Discord as our primary communication channels, with Discord having a more scaffolded setup to allow for structured communication

* Teammates agree to respond to messages within 1 weekday

* If something comes up that prevents a teammate from doing work/attending tutorial or lecture (ie. very busy, fallen ill, etc.) they should communicate it so work can be redistributed

* All behaviour and communiciation will be respectful and inclusive, and every teammate will strive to create a positive and welcoming environment


### Attendance and Participation

* Before lecture, tutorials, or scheduled group meetups, members will come prepared with readings or completed work

* Members will attend all lectures, tutorials, and scheduled group meetups unless they have given a reason otherwise

* If unable to attend, members will decide a way to ensure they can still contribute asynchronously

* During group activities, every member will try to actively participate to ensure activities are completed together


### Work Distribution and Quality

* All members will distribute work as fairly as possible, with each person having a say on proposed work distribution

* Once work is distributed, all members are responsible to finish their part, or to tell the team that they need help/extensions

* Members will look over each other's deliverables and provide constructive edits/criticism to improve the overall project

* Pull requests must be looked over by at least two members thoroughly, and all pull requests created should be detailed and thorough


### Workflow

* One person will be assigned to create a repo and control pull requests

* Core issues should be established, and both issues and subissues should be created to organize work distribution

* Before working on an issue, create a new branch with a clear title (ie. database-creation) to work on

* Once you finish an issue, thoroughly review code, then create a pull request, which after review by two members, can be merged

---

## Decision Making

* Decisions will be made by consensus, with each person having a chance to share opinions and reasoning

* If we struggle to come to a decision, we will choose by the majority

---
## Conflict resolution

* All members agree to be kind and listen to each other's opinions and feelings before sharing their thoughts

* Conflict should be resolved in private through open discussion involving the impacted members

* If the conflict cannot be resolved and is impacting the rest of the team, a mediator (a member of the teaching team) will be involved
  
---

## Accountability

* All members agree to follow the outlined points above and try their best to bring a positive and determined attitude during each meeting

* Failure to meet expectations or consistent absences may result in lower peer evaluation scores

* All members agree to give fair and honest peer feedback
